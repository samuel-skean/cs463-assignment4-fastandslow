Hypothesis: -O3 treats loops that only modify global variables a lot like loops
that only modify local variables, except that they do ensure the global variable
has the correct result when a function returns - unlike with locals, where they
can assume no code outside the function can see the local, and therefore
completely skip writes to it.

Prediction 1: two_opt has no loop in it, but does write to the global at least
once. (I believe it will have a closed-form version of the loop).

Result: True on both counts! Well, the closed-form version is just writing a
constant to memory, since this function does not depend on its operands.

Prediction 2 (sort of about this code): If we revert one_opt to its original
state, it will have no loop or write of the value that should "end up" in count
at the end of the loop. (I expect it to contain none of the semantics we put
into the code).

Result: True on both counts!

Hypothesis 2: Besides making sure the new value of the global variable is
visible on function return, -O3 treats loops that modify global variables and
loops that modify local variables basically the same. Specifically, for two
loops where the only difference is whether they modify a global or they modify a
local, the compiler will either put both of them into closed form or put neither
of them into closed form (and create very similar code for them otherwise).

Prediction 1: If I change the body of the loop in two.c to `count*=8;
count/=3;`, there will be a loop in two_opt.

Predicion 2: The code for two_opt and one_opt will be very similar if the loops
look the same, as long as one.c depends on the value of count somehow
(including with `count++;`, `count+=i`).
