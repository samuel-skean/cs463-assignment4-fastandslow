Hypothesis: -O3 removes code that does not produce observable side-effects.
Modifying a local variable that is never read is not an observable side-effect,
so the entire loop is removed.

Prediction: Making one.c print the value of count after the loop will only slightly increase
the time that one takes, but will significantly increase the time that one_opt
takes.

Result: False. Printing the value of one after the loop only caused a slight
increase in the time each program took.
