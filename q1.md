Hypothesis: -O3 removes code that does not produce observable side-effects.
Modifying a local variable that is never read is not an observable side-effect,
so the entire loop is removed.

Prediction: Making one.c print the value of count after the loop will only slightly increase
the time that one takes, but will significantly increase the time that one_opt
takes.

Result: False. Printing the value of one after the loop only caused a slight
increase in the time each program took.

Postmortem: I believe my prediction didn't really test my hypothesis. My
prediction relied on that being the *only* thing -O3 optimizes, or at least the
only relevant thing -O3 optimizes. Clearly, that wasn't the case, and it wasn't
even part of my hypothesis.

Hypothesis: -O3 tries to convert loops that only modify local variables into
closed form. It can not do this if the body of the loop is sufficiently complicated.

Prediction: If I make the body of the loop complicated enough, while still only
modifying local variables, both programs will run in a similar amount of time
because the compiler will be unable to put the loop into closed form.
