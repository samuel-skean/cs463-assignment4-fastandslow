### array packed vs. 64-byte spread

Preliminary research: Compiling the program with g and -Og, seeing what
addresses it's accessing. Putting the program into gdb, seeing what addresses
it's accessing. Seems that -i 1 is accessing literally consecutive bytes in memory.

Hypothesis: When accessing a byte of memory, the processor ensures that the 64-byte
cache line that contains that byte is in the L1 cache. Subsequent reads of bytes
in the same cache line only result in pulling the memory from a slower cache if
the L1 cache is full. -i 1 is faster than -i 64 because it does more
time-consecutive actions in the same cache line.

Prediction 1: An interval less than 64 will be faster than -i 64, but more than
-i 1.

Result: True for 25 (3.4 ns/ops), 32 (3.7 ns/ops), and 48 (5.6 ns). For
reference: 64 (7.5 ns/ops)

Prediction: Higher multiples of 64 for the interval will not change the runtime,
until it slows the thing down, and then the increasing the size can speed it
back up.
